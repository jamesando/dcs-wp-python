# Python script to replicate Engines Octave functionality

This python script takes a .dat file generated by Combatflite and converts it into a JSON file that can be imported into DCS Waypoint Editor.

## Further requirements

For this script to work within DCSWaypointEditor, it will need to be wrapped in a function whereby the path to the .dat file can be passed as an argument and called during an event.
